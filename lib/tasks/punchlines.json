    "this is asian sam across the street. I have been trapped in a cell under smartbear technologies. If you could look in the cabinets in the third cubicle on the top floor during the lunch break, the keys should be under the company's collection of funko pops that give off uncomfortable or offesive vibes. Please... I never get to leave my box. They lock up the building at night and let me roam for food, but I have been planning my escape. I am barely fed and miss my family. Plea... oh no... oh god no... NOOO!! NOOOO!!!! NOT THE GRUNDLE!!! THE GRUNDLE!!! *STATIC NOISES* *ALARMING SOUNDS OF INTENSE FRICTION* *YOU CAN HEAR THE DEPRESSING PATTER OF SAM'S TEARS HITTING THE GROUND INBETWEEN LOUD SCREAMS AND AN UNIDENTIFIABLE HIGH PITCHED SHREIKING THAT SOUNDS UNHUMAN.*.. the grundle.... it is always the grundle .... *quiet sobbing*",

    "I am sorry to say this but you did not sneeze. I know what I said and what you think happened, but what you did not know is that you were overdosing on over 12 zyprexa and most of what happened that day took place inside a hospital and in the dumpster behind the Texas Road House. I can't hold the truth away anymore. You did not sneeze, you were barely yourself anymore and chasing children in the target parking lot screaming vine references nobody but you understood. they were scared. I was scared... You shouldn't have to know. We thought you died and that is what dumpsters are for... ok??!!? I feel horrible about this. Arielle feels bad too, but you can't go on thinking you sneezed that night still after everything that happened... I... I can't hide it anymore... I'm sorry"
